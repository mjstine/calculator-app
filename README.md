## Introduction

Welcome to the Calculator App project! This project showcases the implementation of a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to perform simple arithmetic calculations in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

### Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Clear and delete functionality
- Decimal point support

By exploring this project, you'll get an understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive and dynamic web applications.

## Demo

## What is the Calculator App Project?

The Calculator App project is a web application that simulates a basic calculator digitally. It allows users to perform arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app showcases the implementation of user interface elements, event handling, and mathematical operations using JavaScript.

## Why I Started This Project

As an aspiring web developer, I embarked on the Calculator App project to solidify my understanding of JavaScript and its real-world applications. By building a calculator, I aimed to reinforce my grasp of essential programming concepts, ranging from variable manipulation to handling user interactions.

This project also provided an opportunity to explore the intersection of user interface design and programming logic. As I delved into the complexities of implementing calculator functionality, I deepened my appreciation for the synergy between design and code.

## Acknowledgments

This project was made possible with the help of various resources and inspirations:

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons used in the app interface.
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum for providing guidance and learning materials.

## Usage

To use the Calculator App:

1. Open the [Live Demo](https://mjstine.github.io/calculator-app/) in your web browser.
2. Click the number buttons to input digits for your calculation.
3. Click the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to choose the desired arithmetic operation.
4. Click the "=" button to see the result of your calculation.
5. Click the "C" button to clear the current calculation.
6. Click the "DEL" button to delete the last entered digit.

The app provides a simple way to perform calculations quickly and conveniently.

### Code Overview

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the calculator interface.
- `css/style.css`: The CSS file defining the visual styling of the calculator.
- `js/script.js`: The JavaScript file implementing the calculator's functionality.

## Contributions and Feedback
